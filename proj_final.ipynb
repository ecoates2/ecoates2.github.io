    "**Analyzing the effects of different risk factors on the presence of heart disease in patients**\n",

    "Heart disease is a term describing several heart conditions putting afflicted patients at risk for serious consequences such as heart attacks, heart failure, and arrhythmia. Heart disease is known to have risk factors, with the 3 major ones (high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking) affecting a whopping 47% of the American population. Through the use of data science techniques, it is possible to gain further insight into how heavily the many risk factors of heart disease weigh in on each other and on the occurrence of heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be analyzing a dataset derived from the CDC's 2020 survey of approximately 400,000 American adults on their health and lifestyle as part of the BRFSS, or Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The BRFSS surveys, conducted in the United States since 1984, question respondees via phone. The original dataset from the survey contained 279 columns with each representing a different question each row (respondee) was asked. \n",
    "\n",
    "This public domain dataset maintains all 401,958 rows of the original but strips the large number of questions down to 18. One of these is if the patient reported heart disease, and the rest are questions about other lifestyle choices and health conditions that may have an effect on whether the patient suffers from heart disease or not. The dataset is available as a CSV (comma-separated values) table, so we'll begin by importing it into a dataframe using PANDAS, a Python library highly optimized for efficiently working with datasets.\n",

While it is possible to use the apply() function in Pandas to convert \"Yes\" into True (and \"No\" into False), it is very inefficient on large datasets like this. So, a vectorized solution is preferred, where a new column of all False values is created and the \"Yes\" values found in the original column are \"masked\" over the new one. Vectorized code like this allows for under-the-hood optimizations by Pandas to take place, reducing the runtime dramatically (in this case, 0.4 vs. 18 seconds!)."
